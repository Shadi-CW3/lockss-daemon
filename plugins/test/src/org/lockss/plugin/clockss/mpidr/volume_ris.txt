N2  - A recently completed series of life tables from 1751 to 1995 is used for identifying four stages of mortality transition in Finland, separated by the years 1880, 1945 and 1970.  The cyclical fluctuation of the death rate in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries is measured and examined in relation to epidemics, famines and wars.  Important permanent changes in mortality also took place in this early period.  Each of the successive stages of transition produced its own characteristic pattern of mortality change which contrasted with those of the other stages.  Finally, the age profile of the years added to life is drawn to illustrate the end result of each stage of mortality transition. (All figures follow at the end of the document.)
