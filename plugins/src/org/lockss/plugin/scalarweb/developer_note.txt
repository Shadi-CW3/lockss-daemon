This is a plugin is different from "org.lockss.plugin.scalar" which uses scalar RDF method to collect information.

This is uses classic plugin method to college information. "Black Quotidian" already collected using
"org.lockss.plugin.scalar". At the moment, Scalar API is broken, use this classic method to see if
we can collect information for "When Melodies Gather" and "Constructing the Sacred".

For NYU project, stanford press, there are three websites which use Scalar framework.

When Melodies Gather: https://www.whenmelodiesgather.org/ -- Scalar 2.1.7b
Constructing the Sacred: https://constructingthesacred.org/ -- Scalar 2.5.11
Black Quotidian: http://blackquotidian.supdigital.org/ -- uses Scalar 2.5.10, collected using "org.lockss.plugin.scalar"
