NOTES from dicussion with Thib for post brak

Try to avoid orphan content by not being too definitive on the AU

The start_url might exist both with and without the index.php so we can't just probe but the
/archives page seems to indicate the consistent path stem (and the one the articles will hang from)

Trying to allow modification later will also involve consuming or normalizing to 
otherwwise handle a mid course transition of the content - basically the URLS will have changed.
We could normalize to help existing AUs to continue if the only difference was index.php or not...

Param thoughts
Ccan't do base + extra bit + jid because 'extra bit' is sometimes null
Attrs?
Is there a way to use optional attr as extra bit rather than a param? 
and then use the crawl seed to build up with the attr - which could change even after release?

But if we could normalize from anyway:
foo.com/index.php/journal/foo/article to foo.com/foo/article
starting with 
param base_url = foo.com
param start_stem = index.php/journal/foo
the crawl seed would just have to overrule the original start_url with the shortened one?
and the crawl rules would have to continue to have optional pattern matching

TODO - PURSUE after break - use of attr in crawl seed - if it's null, just put together base_url and journal_id
if it's not null then base_url + extra bit + journal_id


article iterator needs a lot of efficiency.
