Court website is handled differently from govinfo by the following means:

      sitemap: https://www.govinfo.gov/sitemap/USCOURTS/USCOURTS_akd_2014_sitemap.xml

      au < manifest ; 2014 ; USCOURTS_akd 2014 ; USCOURTS ; akd ; 2014 >
      https://www.govinfo.gov/sitemap/USCOURTS/USCOURTS_akd_2014_sitemap.xml

      https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/USCOURTS-akd-3_08-cv-00162
      https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-akd-1_06-cv-00009.zip
      https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/pkg/USCOURTS-akd-1_06-cv-00009/mods.xml
      https://www.govinfo.gov/metadata/pkg/USCOURTS-akd-1_06-cv-00009/premis.xml


Let's use count_id("akd") as an example:
    1.  The sitemap uses "_" between "USCOURTS" and "akd"
    2.  Other urls uses "-" between "USCOURTS" and "akd"
    3.  It does not provide direct access to its .pdf file, it zipped .pdf and some other content into the .zip
        and zipped the content on nightly basis. An email is sent to contact them to see whether they will provide
        direct access to .pdf in the future
